### Overview of Behaviorism
Behaviorism is the theory that learning is acquired through conditioning, which occurs through interaction with the learner's environment. Two primary components of Behaviorism are Classical Conditioning, or learning through association, and Operant Conditioning, or learning through the consequences of voluntary behaviors. 

Classical Conditioning identifies the following stimulus and responses:
1. Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS): A stimulus that naturally and automatically triggers a response without any prior learning. For example, food is an unconditioned stimulus that elicits salivation in dogs.
2. Unconditioned Response (UCR): The unlearned, naturally occurring response to the unconditioned stimulus. In Pavlov's experiments, salivation in response to food is an unconditioned response.
3. Neutral Stimulus (NS): A stimulus that initially does not trigger any intrinsic response. For example, a bell initially does not cause salivation in dogs.
4. Conditioned Stimulus (CS): A previously neutral stimulus that, after being associated with the unconditioned stimulus, begins to trigger a conditioned response. In Pavlov's experiment, the bell becomes a conditioned stimulus after being repeatedly paired with food.
5. Conditioned Response (CR): The learned response to the previously neutral stimulus, which is now the conditioned stimulus. In the context of Pavlov’s experiment, salivation in response to the bell is a conditioned response.

Operant Conditioning indentified the following reinforcements and punishments:
1. Positive Reinforcement: Adding a stimulus to increase the likelihood of a behavior. For example, giving a dog a treat for sitting on command.
2. Negative Reinforcement: Removing an aversive stimulus to increase the likelihood of a behavior. For example, turning off a loud noise when a rat presses a lever, making the rat more likely to press the lever again.
3. Positive Punishment: Adding an aversive stimulus to decrease a behavior. For example, giving a child extra chores for misbehaving.
4. Negative Punishment: Removing a pleasant stimulus to decrease a behavior. For example, taking away a teenager’s phone for breaking curfew.

Some key dates in the development of Behaviorism are:

### Implications of Behaviorism in Dog Training
I associate Classical Conditioning with animal training and my experience training guide dogs for the blind with the Guide Dog Foundation. Our techniques required us to observe natural responses and, using positive reinforcement, shape the dog's behavior into a new response and helping it associate what it knows to new responses. An example of this is "the boop". Because handlers/owners give the dogs treats by holding up food to the dog's snout, they become conditioned to associate the hand (a neutral stimulus) near the snout as the opportunity for food. This behavior can then be shaped to "the boop," where the handler holds their hand near the dog’s snout and saying the word "touch." When the dog becomes curious it touches its nose to the hand to look for food creating the desired behavior (conditioned response) that the dog is rewarded for. This behavior is reinforced through practice.

Once the dog has this association it is transferred to a more general behavior, "touch." Touch is the association of touching an item such as a door or light switch on voice command. The behavior is transferred by first associating the "touch" with the hand to a pointing stick. This behavior is then graduated to using the stick with the voice command, while pointing at the desired object. Eventually, the dog understands the voice command and you can train it to touch many objects, including a panel switch for a light, which allows it to turn lights on and off for their owner. 

### Strengths and Limitations of Behaviorism in Dog Training
As the course content mentions the Operant Conditioning, reinforcers and punishers can be used for dog training as well. Though the Guide Dog Foundation techniques avoided using Positive Punishments with their dogs, the other three techniques—Positive Reinforcement, Negative Punishment, and Negative Reinforcement, worked quite well. 

However, as a puppy trainer for 7 years, I became keenly aware that younger dogs and more "stubborn" and "high energy" dogs were too distracted and excited, focusing on behaviors such as pulling and jumping, to make the connection with the more beneficial reinforcements and punishment techniques. With my personal dogs, I have effectively utilized Positive Punishments, ensuring not to overuse them or cause the dog harm. My personal observations have been that without fully illustrating the contrast of punishment and reinforcement for the dog, the dog does not learn as quickly and may not adopt the conditioned response.

I believe that the best utilization of Behaviorism is when verbal communication or instructions are limited, such as with an animal, a non-verbal child, or in a situation where communication and instruction distract from the experience and a symbol, such as a badge, can be a shorthand for reinforcement. Additionally, I have seen first-hand how, if the learned behavior is not reinforced and practiced, the new behaviors can quickly become extinct. This is why the Guide Dog Foundation regularly brings their working dogs in for maintenance training.

### Behaviorism and Gamification

In education technology Behaviorism is often utilized in Gamification. Though there are many benefits to gamification, such as motivation, engagement, and instant feedback, the overuse and improper use of Gamification has made some learners weary (Gupta, 2022).

For example, when utilized in corporate training, it can seem condescending or immature for some users. Additionally, ambiguous gamification directions or unclear scoring may lead to erroneous results. To counter this, it is recommended to employ the following principles (Wang, et. al., 2022): 
* Integration of gamification with the curriculum
* Provision of rapid feedback when learners exhibit desirable behavior
* A team-based competition mechanism
* A gradual increase in the difficulties of tasks to be completed by the teams in a limited timeframe. 

Poor implementations of Gamification I have seen are:
* Points that are awarded arbitrarily or without giving the user an understanding of what behavior they have performed to receive the reward
* Utilizing gaming mechanisms, such as battles, that do not connect to the learning objectives
* Overuse of Gamification that becomes distracting

### Learning Scenario
One behavior I would like to reinforce in online learning is Self-Directed Inquiry-Based Learning, as I believe it is crucial in shaping individuals as life-long learners and reinforces autonomy in education. Additionally, it allows teachers to go beyond "a purveyor of information" and allow them to assume the role of facilitator of learning, motivator, designer of the learning situation, and often joining the students in earnest as a co-learner as they learn instructional skills" (Robinson, et. al., 2020).

To build the behavior, an interface could present core information and then provide follow up questions (neutral stimulus) for the first level of mastery, Curiosity. The goal of this level is introducing the idea of inquiry and investigation. To demonstrate their understanding of the desired behavior, the user would click on question prompts which are: 
* **Personalized,** connecting them to what they know (1 pt)
* **Exploratory,** encouraging the user to seek out deeper understanding (2 pt)
* **Cross-disciplined,** connect the information to other disciplines and techniques (3 pt)
* **Imaginative,** encouraging the learner to ask "what if" questions and discover new uses for the information (4 pt)

For this experience, learners would be rewarded for interacting with points and once they hit a threshold, such as 5 interactions with each of the 4 question types, they would move to the next level (positive reinforcement), Self-Directed Inquiry. For Self-Directed Inquiry, learners would be prompted to ask questions about the information, rather than being provided with it. Acquisition of the behavior would be demonstrated the user rewarded by asking the 4 question types on their own. The goal of this level is to create learners that will explore topics on their own. 

The final level of the Self-Directed Inquiry-Based Learning Mastery would be Teaching the Topic. As an instructor and curriculum builder, I have discovered that my mastery of a topic has been primarily developed when I must teach a topic. The role of an instructor or curriculum builder forces the individual to think through what questions will be asked from a variety of experiences and drives the individual to be prepared to be able to answer the questions, creating a Negative Reinforcement scenario by delaying the embarrassment of "not knowing."

Once these levels are achieved, a learner would receive a "Self-Directed Inquiry-Based Learning" badge. However, as described in Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction, the behavior should continue to be practiced enhancing retention. To facilitate this, I may do some user research on a mastery badge that "fades" over time (negative reinforcement) if a user does not utilize this skill. This is similar to the approach taken by Duolingo who's app avatar becomes sad if you do not engage with the app (Enquirer, 2024).

### Overview of Cognitivism
Whereas Behaviorism focuses on how to shape behaviors through external stimulus, Cognitivism focuses on what is going on in the mind as learning occurs. Cognitivism investigates the imapct of thought on learning, rather than the simple reactions to stimuli such as the involuntary drooling of a dog when being fed and how those reactions can be assigned to other behaviors. Cognitivism also introduces the concept of cognitive load and the variability of individual's ability to intake information which can be influenced by presentation methods, content length, and indiviual's cognitiv abilities, and environmental, social, and emotional context, to name a few.

#### Key Principles of Cognitivism
* Learners are active participants in the learning process, not passive recipients of information.
* Learning involves the formation of mental representations or schemas, which are internal structures that help organize and interpret information.
* Prior knowledge significantly influences learning. New information is understood and interpreted based on what the learner already knows.
* Learning is most effective when the material is meaningful and relevant to the learner. Meaningful learning involves understanding the relationships between concepts.
* Learning involves the processing of information through various stages, including encoding, storage, and retrieval.
* Metacognition, or thinking about one's own thinking, is crucial for effective learning. Learners need to be aware of their cognitive processes and strategies.
* Learning is facilitated by providing support and gradually removing it as learners become more proficient. This support, or scaffolding, helps bridge the gap between what learners can do independently and what they can do with assistance.
* Learning is a constructive process where learners build new knowledge upon the foundation of their existing knowledge. Constructivism emphasizes active, hands-on learning and problem-solving.
* The cognitive load theory suggests that learning is affected by the amount of mental effort required to process information. Managing cognitive load is essential for effective learning.
* Feedback is essential for learning as it helps learners understand their progress and areas for improvement.

#### The Process
##### 1. Perception
Sensory information is recieved:
* Touch
* Sight
* Soundh
* Taste
* Smell 
##### 2. Executive Processes
Executive Processes is responsible for:
* Directing attention
* Planning next steps
* Retrieving information from long-term memory
* Monitoring understanding
* Selecting learning strategies
* Regulatign motivation

##### 3. Short-term or working memory
There are four elements that processes sensory information:
* **Central executive**, which controls attention and mental resources
* **Phonological loop**, which processes verbal and auditory information
* **Visuospatial sketchpad**, which works on visual and spatial information
* **Episodic buffer**, which integrates information from the previous processors with information from long-term memory to make sense of it all

#### 4. Encoding
Encoding is the process of organizing the information we recieve, connecting new information to what is already known, and includes:
* Creating hierarchies
* Mnemonic techniques
* Mental imagery

#### 5. Long-Term Memory
Long-term memory is the ability to store information, lon-term, and be able to retrieve them as images, thoughts and idea. Long-term memeory is easier to retrieve when it has been associated with meaningful connections, organized, elaborated upon, and frequently retrieved or practiced.

### Implications of Cognitivism
The implications of Cognitivism in education is that learning is influenced by many internal and external forces and processes and requires a dynamic, in-the-moment, personalized approach, which can be very difficult for teachers or LXD to provide. Most lessons are built in a "one size fits all" manner which speaks to the median learner and is based on standards. Where a teacher in a classroom of 20 students, for example, can try to adapt their content (examples, references, scaffolding) on the fly, it is more practical for this type of dynamism should likely be performed by a computer, which can more easily maintain large quanities of variables. With recent advances in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelegence, personalization seems more possible than ever, however, in order to truely execute optimized a cognitive learning experience, a system would need to have a model of each learner which indcludes, not only what they already know, but how they organize the information, how strong their recall is, and internal and external factors that impact them, both long-term and in the moment.

### Strengths and Limitations of Cognitivism 
I believe one of the strengths of Cognitivism is that it helps to breakdown and illustrate the way an individual learns. However, as it introduces enumorous variables, it makes it a difficult theory to practice in a classroom setting. In order to support individual learners, a system and/or instructor would need to: 
* know what a learner already knows to reduce redundant information
* present in a way that makes sense to a learner
* break down lessons into units that make sense to a learner and introduce them to learners in a way that mathes their abilities and personal organization
* be adaptive to ever changing understaning and preceptions
* provide learners with agency in their learning experience


### Cognativisim and Personalization
Many learning software applications claim to be personalized to learners, especially in recent months where AI has exploded. 

### Cognitivism Usage in Instructional Material

I chose to assess the use of cognitivism in a free course by The Open University call [Exploring the boundaries between religion and culture](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/exploring-the-boundaries-between-religion-and-culture/content-section-0?active-tab=description-tab){:target="_blank"}. This course uses Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) to explore the relationship between religion and culture.
