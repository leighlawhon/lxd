### Copyright
For my copyright, I decided to not allow my work for commercial use, ask for attribution, to have anyone who adapts my work to use the same license. I did this as I feel it is the fairest approach.

## Week 2
### Behaviorism
#### Overview
Behaviorism is the theory that learning is acquired through conditioning, which occurs through interaction with the learner's environment.
{% include behaviorism_timeline %}
Provide an overview of behaviorism with dates, key researchers, and connections to teaching and learning.
Discuss the implications of behaviorism for instructional (learning) design.
Share your opinion on the strengths and limitations of behaviorism in your chosen instructional design context. Examples include education (Kâ€“12 or higher education), corporate training, non-profits, or another professional context you are interested in.  
Imagine you are an instructional designer tasked with creating an online learning experience with behaviorism as the primary learning theory driving the activity. Based on what you have learned this week about behaviorism:

Describe a learning scenario in which behaviorism is the primary learning theory that drives the activity. Do not use an example of something you have experienced firsthand; instead, apply behaviorism to an example you create. Remember, behaviorism is focused on observable behavior, so provide enough detail to explain the behavior you would observe to know if someone learned.
Include the stimulus and the response in the learning scenario and the types of positive and negative reinforcement in your scenario.
