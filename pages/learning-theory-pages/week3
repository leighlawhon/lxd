### Overview of Cognitivism
Whereas Behaviorism focuses on how to shape behaviors through external stimulus, Cognitivism focuses on what is going on in the mind as learning occurs. Cognitivism investigates the imapct of thought on learning, rather than the simple reactions to stimuli such as the involuntary drooling of a dog when being fed and how those reactions can be assigned to other behaviors. Cognitivism also introduces the concept of cognitive load and the variability of individual's ability to intake information which can be influenced by presentation methods, content length, and indiviual's cognitiv abilities, and environmental, social, and emotional context, to name a few.

#### Key Principles of Cognitivism
* Learners are active participants in the learning process, not passive recipients of information.
* Learning involves the formation of mental representations or schemas, which are internal structures that help organize and interpret information.
* Prior knowledge significantly influences learning. New information is understood and interpreted based on what the learner already knows.
* Learning is most effective when the material is meaningful and relevant to the learner. Meaningful learning involves understanding the relationships between concepts.
* Learning involves the processing of information through various stages, including encoding, storage, and retrieval.
* Metacognition, or thinking about one's own thinking, is crucial for effective learning. Learners need to be aware of their cognitive processes and strategies.
* Learning is facilitated by providing support and gradually removing it as learners become more proficient. This support, or scaffolding, helps bridge the gap between what learners can do independently and what they can do with assistance.
* Learning is a constructive process where learners build new knowledge upon the foundation of their existing knowledge. Constructivism emphasizes active, hands-on learning and problem-solving.
* The cognitive load theory suggests that learning is affected by the amount of mental effort required to process information. Managing cognitive load is essential for effective learning.
* Feedback is essential for learning as it helps learners understand their progress and areas for improvement.

#### The Process

**1. Perception**

Sensory information is recieved:
* Touch
* Sight
* Soundh
* Taste
* Smell 

**2. Executive Processes**

Executive Processes is responsible for:
* Directing attention
* Planning next steps
* Retrieving information from long-term memory
* Monitoring understanding
* Selecting learning strategies
* Regulatign motivation

**3. Short-term or working memory**

There are four elements that processes sensory information:
* **Central executive**, which controls attention and mental resources
* **Phonological loop**, which processes verbal and auditory information
* **Visuospatial sketchpad**, which works on visual and spatial information
* **Episodic buffer**, which integrates information from the previous processors with information from long-term memory to make sense of it all

**4. Encoding**

Encoding is the process of organizing the information we recieve, connecting new information to what is already known, and includes:
* Creating hierarchies
* Mnemonic techniques
* Mental imagery

**5. Long-Term Memory**

Long-term memory is the ability to store information, lon-term, and be able to retrieve them as images, thoughts and idea. Long-term memeory is easier to retrieve when it has been associated with meaningful connections, organized, elaborated upon, and frequently retrieved or practiced.

### Implications of Cognitivism
The implications of Cognitivism in education is that learning is influenced by many internal and external forces and processes and requires a dynamic, in-the-moment, personalized approach, which can be very difficult for teachers or LXD to provide. Most lessons are built in a "one size fits all" manner which speaks to the median learner and is based on standards. Where a teacher in a classroom of 20 students, for example, can try to adapt their content (examples, references, scaffolding) on the fly, it is more practical for this type of dynamism should likely be performed by a computer, which can more easily maintain large quanities of variables. With recent advances in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelegence, personalization seems more possible than ever, however, in order to truely execute optimized a cognitive learning experience, a system would need to have a model of each learner which indcludes, not only what they already know, but how they organize the information, how strong their recall is, and internal and external factors that impact them, both long-term and in the moment.

### Strengths and Limitations of Cognitivism 
I believe one of the strengths of Cognitivism is that it helps to breakdown and illustrate the way an individual learns. However, as it introduces enumorous, multi-dimensional variables, cognitivism is a difficult theory to practice in a classroom setting. For example, if you look at Bruner's "spiral curriculum," concept and a learner's need to "unfold in a progressive and interconnected manner, building upon previously acquired knowledge" it is clear that this state is difficult to achieve if a teacher or system has no, or limitted understanding of a learner's aquired knowledge. Which is why, I believe standards were created. It is easier to teach a group of students that have met certain requirements—"5th grade students should know..." than it is to teach a student where they are.

In order to support individual learners, a system and/or instructor would need to: 
* know what a learner already knows to reduce redundant information
* present in a way that makes sense to a learner and their rediness
* break down lessons into units that make sense to a learner and introduce them to learners in a way that mathes their abilities and personal organization or schema
* be adaptive to ever changing understaning and preceptions
* provide learners with agency in their learning experience


### Cognativisim and Personalization
Many learning software applications claim to be personalized to learners, especially in recent months where AI has exploded. 

One application that looks promissing in the arena of personalization for learners is MindPrint Learning, whos assessment is based on cognitive theory.

### Cognitivism Usage in Instructional Material

I chose to assess the use of cognitivism in a free course by The Open University call [Exploring the boundaries between religion and culture](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/exploring-the-boundaries-between-religion-and-culture/content-section-0?active-tab=description-tab){:target="_blank"}. This course uses Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) to explore the relationship between religion and culture. Using Vygotsky’s Zone Of Proximal Development (ZPD) and the "More Knowledgeable Other," which can include technology systems, the incorporation of questions, either/or, or both/and helps learners develop their own thoughts, while first being presented with a form of inquiry that a learner can mimic.

The "Exploring the boundaries between religion and culture" course uses the following principles:
